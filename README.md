Repository of some older code to supplement my candidacy


Predator/Prey game (very) loosely based on this [example code](https://www.daniweb.com/software-development/cpp/threads/367951/prey-predator-game#)

 - (rules for the game found [here](http://s1.zetaboards.com/Evanity_Games/topic/3347927/1/) and elsewhere)

TwitterAPItest program is an earlier version.  I can't find the one where I'm post-rprocessing the tweets.  I have forked the Twitterizer library (still exists!) for your convenience.  The actual DLLs were in the \Program Files directory of an old machine, so I don't have the latest version of the MySQL connector handy.

I will be able to upload the .frm files for the tables of "twitterdb" that's used in the code, but I want to make sure I can scrub the authorization keys from them first.
